                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>Pharaoh's Island (Arabic: جزيرة فرعون‎ Jazīrat Fir‘aun) is an island
                                in the northern Gulf of Aqaba some 200 meters east off the shore of Egypt's eastern
                                Sinai Peninsula. The island is 350 metres (380 yd) long north-south, and up to 170
                                metres (190 yd) wide. The area is 3.9 hectares (9.6 acres). Although the Crusaders
                                reached the head of the Gulf of Aqaba in 1116, they did not take control of the oasis of
                                Aila, which was in Muslim hands as late as 1154. In the early 1160s, the Crusaders
                                allegedly built a castle on Pharaoh's Island but there is no evidence to support
                                this.[1] The name île de Graye, by which the island and castle are commonly known, is a
                                19th-century invention from Arabic qurayya, "little village". Contemporary chronicles
                                call it Aila, like the oasis.[2][3]

                                In December 1170, Saladin conquered the island and reconstructed the citadel and left a
                                garrison of men there. In November 1181, Raynald of Châtillon raided the Arab-held Aila
                                and attempted to set up a naval blockade against the Muslim troops there during the
                                winter of 1182 to 1183. The blockade consisted of only two ships and was not successful.
                                By the time of the 13th century, when the pilgrim Thietmar passed the island in 1217,
                                the entire place was inhabited by a fishing village and populated by Muslims and
                                captive. The Mamluk governor of the city of Aqaba lived in the citadel until some time
                                in the 14th century, around 1320, when the seat of governorship was moved into the city
                                itself.[2]
