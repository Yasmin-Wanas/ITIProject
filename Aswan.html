                            <p>Kitchener’s Island, to the west of Elephantine Island, was given to Lord Horatio
                                Kitchener in the 1890s when he was commander of the Egyptian army. Indulging his passion
                                for beautiful palms and plants, Kitchener turned the entire island into the stunning
                                Aswan Botanical Gardens, importing plants from the Far East, India and parts of Africa.
                                Covering 6.8 hectares, the gardens are filled with birds as well as hundreds of species
                                of flora. While it may have lost some of its former glory, its majestic trees are still
                                a stunning sight, particularly just before sunset when the light is softer and the scent
                                of sandalwood floats on the breeze. Avoid Fridays, when the place is invaded by
                                picnicking extended families with stereos. Instead, come late afternoon when there is
                                hardly anyone.

                                The island is most easily seen as part of a felucca tour. Alternatively, take the
                                northernmost ferry to Elephantine Island and walk through the village to the other side
                                of the island, where a few little feluccas wait on the western edge to take visitors
                                across to the gardens. Expect to pay at least LE50 to LE60 for a round trip.

                                The Nubian Museum (officially the International Museum of Nubia) is an archaeological
                                museum located in Aswan, Upper Egypt. It was built to a design by architect Mahmoud
                                El-Hakim for an estimated construction cost of LE 75 million (approximately $22 million
                                at the time). Dedicated to Nubian culture and civilization, it was inaugurated on
                                November 23, 1997, and was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2001. The
                                Nubian Museum covers an area of 50,000 square meters, 7,000 of which are devoted to the
                                building, while the rest are devoted to gardens and other public spaces. The building
                                has three floors for displaying and housing, in addition to a library and information
                                center. The largest part of the museum is occupied by the monumental pieces, reflecting

                                Egyptian Arabic: جزيرة الفنتين‎, romanized: Gazīrat il-Fantīn; Greek: Ἐλεφαντίνη
                                Elephantíne; Coptic: (Ⲉ)ⲓⲏⲃ (Ə)iêw) is an island on the Nile, forming part of the city
                                of Aswan in Upper Egypt. There are archaeological sites on the island. Elephantine is
                                1,200 metres (3,900 ft) from north to south, and is 400 metres (1,300 ft) across at its
                                widest point. The layout of this and other nearby islands in Aswan can be seen from west
                                bank hillsides along the Nile. The island is located just downstream of the First
                                Cataract, at the southern border of Upper Egypt with Lower Nubia. This region above is
                                referred to as Upper Egypt because it is further up the Nile.

                                The island may have received its name after its shape, which in aerial views is similar
                                to that of an elephant tusk, or from the rounded rocks along the banks resembling
                                elephants.</p>

                                Nasser, Egypt. Philae was originally located near the expansive First Cataract of the
                                Nile in Upper Egypt and was the site of an Egyptian temple complex. These rapids and the
                                surrounding area have been variously flooded since the initial construction of the Aswan
                                Low Dam in 1902.[3] The temple complex was dismantled and moved to nearby Agilkia Island
                                as part of the UNESCO Nubia Campaign project, protecting this and other complexes before

                                complex are being studied and published by the Philae Temple Text Project of the
                                Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna (Institute OREA).

                                Sultan Muhammed Shah, who died in 1957. The mausoleum is located at Aswan, along the
                                Nile of Egypt, since Egypt was formerly the centre of power of the Fatimids.

                                The mausoleum is built in the style of the Fatimid tombs in Cairo.[citation needed] It
                                is built of pink limestone, while the tomb is built of white Carrara marble. The Aga
                                Khan was buried there two years after he died, since he used to spend part of the winter
                                season living in a nearby villa.

                                A red rose is laid on the Aga Khan's tomb every day--a practice first started by the Aga
                                Khan's wife, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan.

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p> <br> <b>History: </b>The Temple of Kom Ombo is an unusual double temple in the town of
                                Kom Ombo in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt. It was constructed during the Ptolemaic
                                dynasty, 180–47 BC. Some additions to it were later made during the Roman period. The
                                building is unique because its 'double' design meant that there were courts, halls,
                                sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods. The southern half of the
                                temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the
                                world with Hathor and Khonsu.[2] Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was
                                dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris ("Horus the Elder"), along "with Tasenetnofret (the
                                Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnet/Tefnut) and Panebtawy (Lord of the
                                Two Lands)." The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along
                                the main axis.

                                The texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to
                                those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters
                                invoked the gods of Kom Ombo and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple:
                                the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this
                                temple. A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however,
                                this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Little remains of the New
                                Kingdom temple.[5] The existing temple was begun by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC)
                                at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemies, most notably Ptolemy XIII
                                Theos Philopator (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyles. The scene on the
                                inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and "probably
                                represents a set of surgical instruments."

                                Much of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who
                                used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts,
                                who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of
                                the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.[2]

                                A few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in
                                The Crocodile Museum.

                                In September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone sphinx
                                statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately 28 cm (11
                                in) in width and 38 cm (15 in) in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>The Aswan High Dam or Old Aswan Dam is a gravity masonry buttress

                                on the Nile River in Aswan, Egypt. The dam was built at the former first cataract of the
                                Nile, and is located about 1000 km up-river and 690 km (direct distance) south-southeast
                                of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had
                                ever been attempted; on completion, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. The dam
                                was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater and augment dry season flows to
                                support greater irrigation development and population growth in the lower Nile. The
                                dam, originally limited in height by conservation concerns, worked as designed, but
                                provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice,
                                between 1907 and 1912 and again in 1929–1933. These heightenings still did not meet
                                irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped in an effort to maximize pool
                                elevation. This led to the investigation and construction of the Aswan High Dam 6
                                kilometres (3.7 mi) upstream..

                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>Nubian village (/ˈnuːbiə, ˈnjuː-/) is a region along the Nile river
                                encompassing the area between the first cataract of the Nile (just south of Aswan in
                                southern Egypt)[2][3] and the confluence of the blue and white Niles (south of Khartoum
                                in central Sudan)[3] or, more strictly, Al Dabbah.[2][4] It was the seat of one of the
                                earliest civilizations of ancient Africa, the Kerma culture, which lasted from around
                                2500 BC until its conquest by the New Kingdom of Egypt under pharaoh Thutmose I around
                                1500 BC. Nubia was home to several empires, most prominently the kingdom of Kush, which
                                conquered Egypt during the 8th century BC during the reign of Piye and ruled the country
                                as its Twenty-fifth Dynasty (to be replaced a century later by the native Egyptian
                                Twenty-sixth Dynasty).

                                The collapse of Kush, in the 4th century AD after more than a thousand years of
                                existence, was precipitated by an invasion by Ethiopia's Kingdom of Aksum and saw the
                                rise of three Christian kingdoms, Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia. Makuria and Alodia also
                                lasted for roughly a millennium. Their eventual decline initiated not only the partition
                                of Nubia into the northern half conquered by the Ottomans and the southern half by the
                                Sennar sultanate in the 16th century, but also a rapid Islamization and partial
                                Arabization of the Nubian people. Nubia was again united with the Khedivate of Egypt in
                                the 19th century. Today, the region of Nubia is split between Egypt and Sudan.
