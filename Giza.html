                            <p>The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), also known as the Giza Museum, will house artifacts of
                                ancient Egypt, including the complete Tutankhamun collection; many pieces will be
                                displayed for the first time. Described as the largest archaeological museum in the
                                world, construction on the museum was set to be complete in the first quarter of
                                2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the museum opening was moved to 2021.

                                The museum is sited on 50 hectares (120 acres) of land approximately two kilometers from
                                the Giza pyramid complex and is part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau. It is
                                expected to become the centre for culture and education, encouraging enthusiasm about
                                Egypt's history.</p>

                                The Great Sphinx of Giza, commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or just the Sphinx,
                                is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion
                                and the head of a human. Facing directly from West to East, it stands on the Giza
                                Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx is generally
                                believed to represent the pharaoh Khafre.

                                Cut from the bedrock, the original shape of the Sphinx has been restored with layers of
                                blocks.[3] It measures 73 m (240 ft) long from paw to tail, 20 m (66 ft) high from the
                                base to the top of the head and 19 m (62 ft) wide at its rear haunches. It is the
                                oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt and is commonly believed to have been
                                designed, sculpted, and constructed by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom during the
                                reign of the pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558–2532 BC) </p>

                            <p><b>History :</b>In 1908, after receiving approval and a number of silver antiquities from
                                Patriarch Cyril V and raising funds by public subscription, Marcus Simaika Pasha built
                                the Coptic Museum and inaugurated it on 14 March 1910. The Coptic community was
                                generous in their support of the museum, donating many vestments, frescoes, and icons.
                                In 1931 the Coptic Museum became a state museum, under the jurisdiction of the
                                Department of Antiquities, and in 1939 the collection of Christian antiquities in the
                                Egyptian Museum was moved there. These were housed in the New Wing, completed in
                                1944. Because of damage, the Old Wing was closed in 1966, and the entire museum was
                                renovated between 1983 and 1984. The foundations of the museum were strengthened and
                                reinforced between 1986 and 1988, which helped the museum survive the 1992
                                earthquake. Further renovations took place in 2005–06.

                                Marcus Simaika Pasha was followed by Dr Togo Mina and then by Dr Pahor Labib, the first
                                to have the title of Director of the Coptic Museum. Besides the museum buildings, there
                                are gardens and courtyards and the area is surrounded by old Coptic churches. There are
                                six churches, some which have origins as early as the 5th century AD. These old edifices
                                include the (Hanging church) of the Virgin Mary and the church of St. Sergius.

                                The Coptic Museum's grounds are a peaceful and tranquil place. Its airy building is
                                paved with mosaics and decorated with old mashrabiya screens. The museum houses an
                                extensive collection of objects from the Christian era, which links the Pharaonic and
                                Islamic periods. The artefacts on display illustrate a period of Egypt's history which
                                is often neglected and they show how the artistic development of the Coptic culture was
                                influenced by the pharaonic, Graeco-Roman and Islamic cultures. The museum was renovated
                                in the early 1980 with two new annexes, which with the original aisles, houses the
                                collection of 16,000 artefacts arranged in chronological order through twelve
                                sections.

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p> <br><b>History:</b>Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church is traditionally believed to have
                                been built on the spot where the Holy Family, Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus Christ,
                                rested at the end of their journey into Egypt. They may have lived here while Joseph
                                worked at the fortress.

                                The church is of significant historical importance, and in fact, it is where many
                                patriarchs of the Coptic Church were elected. The first to be elected here was Patriarch
                                Isaac (681-692) It is the episcopal church of Cairo, and it was the episcopal See of
                                Masr (the district of Old Cairo) that replaced the former See of Babylon. Many bishops
                                of the See were consecrated in the Church until the reign of Patriarch Christodulus
                                (1047–1077).The church is dedicated to Sergius and Bacchus, who were soldier-saints
                                martyred during the 4th century in Syria by the Roman Emperor Maximian. The most
                                interesting feature is the crypt where Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus are said to
                                have rested. The crypt is 10 meters deep and, when Nile levels are high, is often

                                The Church was built in the 4th century and was probably finished during the 5th
                                century. It was burned during the fire of Fustat during the reign of Marwan II around
                                750. It was then restored during the 8th century, and has been rebuilt and restored
                                constantly since medieval times; however, it is still considered to be a model of the
                                early Coptic churches. Again, the most precious and ancient of the icons are on the
                                southern wall. A vast central hall is divided into three naves by two rows of pilasters

                                interesting fact, he was also the person who rediscovered the ancient Egyptian art of
                                papermaking (Papyrus).The Pharaonic Village is a historic experience not to be missed.
                                It is a unique place where Egypt's entire history is explained in 2-3 hours, from
                                ancient living to modern times. The Pharaonic Village is a great introduction to Egypt,
                                a perfect stop for anyone's first trip to Egypt.. It is located on an island in the
                                Nile, just 3 miles south of the center of Cairo. In this village, you are transported by
                                floating amphitheaters, while a hundred actors and actresses demonstrate scenes from
                                ancient Egypt (papyrus making, sculpting, home building….etc.). It is truly a
                                one-of-a-kind experience you cannot find anywhere else. This trip is definitely one your

                                museums, 4 related to ancient Egypt (mummification and medicine, pyramid building, arts
                                and beliefs, ancient Egyptian boats) and 5 museums related to other periods in Egyptian
                                history (Cleopatra's museum, Coptic history, Islamic civilization, Napoleon's expedition
                                to Egypt, Egypt's modern history museum). There are even 3 museums related to our late

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>The Giza Zoo (Egyptian Arabic: حَدِيْقَة حَيْوَان ٱلْجِيْزَة‎,
                                romanized: Ḥadīqat Ḥaywān Al-Gīzah) is a zoological garden in Giza, Egypt. It is one of
                                the few green areas in the city, and includes Giza's largest park. The zoo covers about
                                80 acres (32 ha), and is home to many endangered species, as well as a selection of
                                endemic fauna.

                                The first to be built in the Middle East, rare species have been successfully bred in
                                the zoo—including the first California sea lion to be born in the region. The zoo was
                                built by Khedive Ismail and opened on 1 March 1891. It was built on about 50 feddan (21
                                hectares (52 acres)) that was once part of the harem gardens. Ismail imported many
                                plants from India, Africa, and South America, of which a banyan tree planted about 1871
                                can still be seen. The original 180 birds and 78 other animals in the zoo's collection
                                were taken from Ismail's private menagerie.

                                In the late 1870s the state took over the zoo as partial payment of the Ismail's debts.
                                In January 1890, the harem building was opened as a natural history museum, and was used
                                in this manner until a new museum was opened in Tahrir Square in 1902. The portion of
                                the gardens facing the Nile were sold to the public for large homes, but the harem
                                gardens were kept intact.

                                When the zoo was built, the exhibits with semi-natural habitats were considered spacious
                                by European standards. The animal collection emphasized Egyptian species, and at one
                                time claimed 20,000 individuals representing 400 species, though many of these may have
                                been migratory birds.

                                Around 1900 Captain Stanley Smyth Flower was appointed director of the Gardens. He would
                                remain in that position until his retirement in 1923. From 1906 to 1923 Michael John
                                Nicoll was his assistant. For a short time he was director, but the next year he had to
                                retire.[6] J. Lewis Bonhote worked at the Gardens from 1913 to 1919.

                                By the mid-twentieth century, the zoo was considered one of the best zoos in the world,
                                but it has had trouble adapting to the pressures of growth in the latter half of the
                                century as human populations in Cairo have increased.

                                By the end of World War II the zoo claimed 4,700 exhibits, with a total of 700 mammals
                                and 500 reptiles. Attendance levels of 43,567 in 1889 rose to 223,525 by 1906. In
                                2007, the zoo hosted almost 3.4 million visitors.

                                In 2004, the zoo lost its membership with the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums
                                (WAZA), because it did not pay membership fees, and then ignored the recommendations
                                of WAZA inspectors. As of 2010, it is a member of the African Association of Zoos and
                                Aquaria (PAAZAB), and is working towards getting re-accredited by WAZA.

                                Egypt. It is located at Giza, in Cairo. It dates back to 1875 and the reign of Khedive
                                Isma'il Pasha who established the garden on a larger site than it presently occupies as
                                part of the Palace of the Khedive. A great lover of gardens, the Khedive entrusted the
                                design of the garden to the French landscaper Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps. It became
                                a public botanical garden in 1910/1917 and put under the Ministry of Agriculture
                                management.

                                The garden covers about 28 acres. Today, the garden contains a rock garden, a rose
                                garden, cactus gardens, and probably the most notable feature, the lotus pond.

                                Orman Garden is located west of the River Nile and east of Cairo University in the Giza
                                Governorate. “Orman” is a Turkish word, which means “the forest”. A small botanical
                                museum attached to the garden shelters herbaria dating from the Ismail khedive and
                                furniture from the king Farouk.
