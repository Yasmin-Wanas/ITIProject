                                The mountain contains number of tombs. The tombs, which cover every inch of its base and
                                are situated on its terraces and on all sides of the conical part, date from the 26th
                                dynasty , the Greek and the Roman periods, though there appear to be no Christian
                                burials.


                                One of the most famous tombs is that of Si-Amun which is considered the most beautiful
                                one in the oasis of the Western desert. The tomb dates to about the 3rd century BC. It
                                was discovered in October,1940 and unfortunately, some of its decorations were badly
                                damaged by soldiers in Siwa at that time, who cut away parts of the painted plaster. The
                                tomb, as with others in the area, was robbed during the Roman period. </p>

                                Fantasy Island is an American fantasy drama television series created by Gene Levitt. It
                                aired on the ABC television network from 1977 to 1984. The series starred Ricardo
                                Montalbán as the mysterious Mr. Roarke and Hervé Villechaize as his assistant Tattoo.
                                Guests were granted so-called "fantasies" on the island for a price.

                                A one-season revival of the series aired 14 years later in 1998 while a horror film
                                adaptation was released on February 14, 2020.</p>

                                remains of this 13th-century mud-brick fortress. Built from kershef (chunks of salt from
                                the lake just outside town, mixed with rock and plastered in local clay), the labyrinth
                                of huddled buildings was originally four or five storeys high and housed hundreds of
                                people. A path leads over the slumping remnants, past the Old Mosque with its
                                chimney-shaped minaret, to the top for panoramic views.

                                one of the governorates of Egypt. It is in the southwestern part of the country, in
                                Egypt's Western Desert (part of the Sahara Desert), between the Nile, northern Sudan,
                                and southeastern Libya.

                                Consisting of roughly half of Egypt's area, this spacious governorate is the country's
                                largest and most sparsely populated, and one of the biggest subnational divisions on the
                                African continent, as well as the world. At 440,098 square kilometers in area, New
                                Valley Governorate is just slightly larger than the country of Iraq. The capital is at
                                the Kharga Oasis.
