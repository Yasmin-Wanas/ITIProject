                                The village, which later evolved into what is now the city of Hurghada, was settled in
                                1905. It acquired its name from a plant which has grown naturally since ancient times.
                                By then it was only a fishing village. Oil was discovered in the area in 1913, but
                                actual production and export only began in 1921 under British oil magnates. During the
                                reign of King Farouk a recreational center was built in the city, but after President
                                Nasser's nationalization of Egypt's industries it was turned over to the armed forces.

                                During the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt, Shadwan island east of the city in
                                the Red Sea, was fortified and held by Egyptian troops and used as a radar post. On 22
                                January 1970, it was the site of Operation Rhodes, a heliborne assault by Israeli troops
                                which occupied the island for 36 hours.

                                During the October War of 1973, Hurghada harbor was target for four Israeli operations
                                [he]. Israeli forces also[when?]occupied Shadwan Island with over 32 casualties to the
                                Egyptian army, and only 7 to the Israeli army .[citation needed]

                                On September 27, 1994 drive-by shooters killed two Egyptians and a German tourist;
                                another German man was wounded in the attack and died of his injuries after returning to
                                Germany.[2] The 2016 Hurghada attack was caused by two terrorists inspired by IS. Three
                                tourists were wounded.[3] On 14 July 2017, in the 2017 Hurghada attack a man
                                proclaiming, that he wanted to kill only non-Egyptians, attacked and stabbed five
                                German, one Czech and one Armenian tourists, all women, killing two German women. The
                                Czech tourist later died on July 27 in the hospital. The attack occurred at two separate
                                resort hotels.</p>
