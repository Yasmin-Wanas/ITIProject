                            <p>The Valley of the Kings (Arabic: وادي الملوك‎ Wādī al Mulūk; Coptic: ϫⲏⲙⲉ, romanized:
                                džēme),also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings (Arabic: وادي ابواب
                                الملوك‎ Wādī Abwāb al Mulūk), is a valley in Egypt where, for a period of nearly 500
                                years from the 16th to 11th century BC, rock cut tombs were excavated for the pharaohs
                                and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth to the Twentieth Dynasties of
                                Ancient Egypt).

                                The valley stands on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes (modern Luxor), within
                                the heart of the Theban Necropolis. The wadi consists of two valleys, East Valley
                                (where the majority of the royal tombs are situated) and West Valley.

                                With the 2005 discovery of a new chamber and the 2008 discovery of two further tomb
                                entrances, the valley is known to contain 63 tombs and chambers (ranging in size from
                                KV54, a simple pit, to KV5, a complex tomb with over 120 chambers). It was the
                                principal burial place of the major royal figures of the Egyptian New Kingdom, as well
                                as a number of privileged nobles. The royal tombs are decorated with scenes from
                                Egyptian mythology and give clues as to the beliefs and funerary rituals of the period.
                                Almost all of the tombs seem to have been opened and robbed in antiquity, but they still
                                give an idea of the opulence and power of the pharaohs.

                                This area has been a focus of archaeological and Egyptological exploration since the end
                                of the eighteenth century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and
                                interest. In modern times the valley has become famous for the discovery of the tomb of
                                Tutankhamun (with its rumours of the curse of the pharaohs),[8] and is one of the most
                                famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site,
                                along with the rest of the Theban Necropolis.[9] Exploration, excavation and
                                conservation continues in the valley, and a new tourist centre has recently been opened.

                                The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (/ˈkɑːr.næk/,[1] from Arabic Khurnak
                                meaning "fortified village"), comprises a vast mix of decayed temples, chapels, pylons,
                                and other buildings near Luxor, in Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the
                                reign of Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom (around 2000–1700 BC) and continued into the
                                Ptolemaic period (305–30 BC), although most of the extant buildings date from the New
                                Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut ("The Most Selected
                                of Places") and the main place of worship of the Eighteenth Dynasty Theban Triad with
                                the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes. The Karnak
                                complex gives its name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of
                                El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor. The complex is a vast open site
                                and includes the Karnak Open Air Museum. It is believed to be the second[citation
                                needed] most visited historical site in Egypt; only the Giza Pyramids near Cairo receive
                                more visits. It consists of four main parts, of which only the largest is currently open
                                to the general public. The term Karnak often is understood as being the Precinct of
                                Amun-Ra only, because this is the only part most visitors see. The three other parts,
                                the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Montu, and the dismantled Temple of Amenhotep IV,
                                are closed to the public. There also are a few smaller temples and sanctuaries
                                connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amun-Re, and the Luxor Temple.

                                The Precinct of Mut is very ancient, being dedicated to an Earth and creation deity, but
                                not yet restored. The original temple was destroyed and partially restored by
                                Hatshepsut, although another pharaoh built around it in order to change the focus or
                                orientation of the sacred area. Many portions of it may have been carried away for use
                                in other buildings.</p>

                                Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الاقصر) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on
                                the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and
                                was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it is known as ipet
                                resyt, "the southern sanctuary". In Luxor there are several great temples on the east
                                and west banks. Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers include
                                the Temple of Seti I at Gurnah, the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri, the Temple of
                                Ramesses II (a.k.a. Ramesseum), and the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu; the two
                                primary cults' temples on the east bank are known as the Karnak and Luxor.[1] Unlike the
                                other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified
                                version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation
                                of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in
                                reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was
                                crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).

                                To the rear of the temple are chapels built by Amenhotep III of the 18th Dynasty, and
                                Alexander. Other parts of the temple were built by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. During
                                the Roman era, the temple and its surroundings were a legionary fortress and the home of
                                the Roman government in the area. During the Roman period a chapel inside the Luxor
                                Temple originally dedicated to the goddess Mut was transformed into a Tetrarchy cult
                                chapel and later into a church.</p>

                            <p><b>History :</b>The twin statues depict Amenhotep III (fl. 14th century BC) in a seated
                                position, his hands resting on his knees and his gaze facing eastwards (actually ESE in
                                modern bearings) towards the river. Two shorter figures are carved into the front throne
                                alongside his legs: these are his wife Tiye and mother Mutemwiya. The side panels depict
                                the Nile god Hapi. The statues are made from blocks of quartzite sandstone which was
                                quarried at el-Gabal el-Ahmar (near modern-day Cairo) and transported 675 km (420 mi)
                                overland to Thebes (Luxor). The stones are believed to be too heavy to have been
                                transported upstream on the Nile. The blocks used by later Roman engineers to
                                reconstruct the northern colossus may have come from Edfu (north of Aswan). Including
                                the stone platforms on which they stand – themselves about 4 m (13 ft) – the colossi
                                reach a towering 18 m (60 ft) in height and weigh an estimated 720 tons each.
                                The two figures are about 15 m (50 ft) apart.

                                Both statues are quite damaged, with the features above the waist virtually
                                unrecognizable. The southern statue comprises a single piece of stone, but the northern
                                figure has a large extensive crack in the lower half and above the waist consists of 5
                                tiers of stone. These upper levels consist of a different type of sandstone, and are the
                                result of a later reconstruction attempt, which William de Wiveleslie Abney attributed
                                to Septimus Severus.[6] It is believed that originally the two statues were identical to

                                The original function of the Colossi was to stand guard at the entrance to Amenhotep's
                                memorial temple (or mortuary temple): a massive construct built during the pharaoh's
                                lifetime, where he was worshipped as a god-on-earth both before and after his departure
                                from this world. In its day, this temple complex was the largest and most opulent in
                                Egypt. Covering a total of 35 hectares (86 acres), even later rivals such as Ramesses
                                II's Ramesseum or Ramesses III's Medinet Habu were unable to match it in area; even the
                                Temple of Karnak, as it stood in Amenhotep's time, was smaller

                            <p> <br><b>History:</b>The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, also known as the Djeser-Djeseru
                                (Ancient Egyptian: ḏsr ḏsrw "Holy of Holies"), is a mortuary temple of Ancient Egypt
                                located in Upper Egypt. Built for the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut, who died in
                                1458 BC, the temple is located beneath the cliffs at Deir el-Bahari on the west bank of
                                the Nile near the Valley of the Kings. This mortuary temple is dedicated to Amun and
                                Hatshepsut and is situated next to the mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II, which served
                                both as an inspiration and, later, a quarry. It is considered one of the "incomparable
                                monuments of ancient Egypt.Hatshepsut's chancellor, the royal architect Senenmut,
                                oversaw the construction of the temple.[2] Although the adjacent, earlier mortuary
                                temple of Mentuhotep II was used as a model, the two structures are nevertheless
                                significantly different in many ways. Hatshepsut's temple employs a lengthy, colonnaded
                                terrace that deviates from the centralised structure of Mentuhotep’s model – an anomaly
                                that may be caused by the decentralized location of her burial chamber.There are
                                three layered terraces reaching 29.5 metres (97 ft) tall. Each story is articulated by a
                                double colonnade of square piers, with the exception of the northwest corner of the
                                central terrace, which employs proto-Doric columns to house the chapel. These terraces
                                are connected by long ramps which were once surrounded by gardens with foreign plants
                                including frankincense and myrrh trees. The temple incorporates pylons, courts,
                                hypostyle, sun court, chapel, and sanctuary.

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p> br> <b>History: </b>The Valley of the Queens (Arabic: وادي الملكات‎ Wādī al Malekāt) is
                                a site in Egypt, where the wives of pharaohs were buried in ancient times. It was known
                                then as Ta-Set-Neferu, meaning "the place of beauty". It was most famous for being the
                                burial site of many wives of Pharaohs. Pharaohs themselves were buried in The Valley
                                of the Kings.

                                Using the limits described by Christian Leblanc, the Valley of the Queens consists of
                                the main wadi, which contains most of the tombs, along with the Valley of Prince Ahmose,
                                the Valley of the Rope, the Valley of the Three Pits, and the Valley of the Dolmen. The
                                main wadi contains 91 tombs and the subsidiary valleys add another 19 tombs. The burials
                                in the subsidiary valleys all date to the 18th Dynasty.

                                The reason for choosing the Valley of the Queens as a burial site is not known. The
                                close proximity to the workers' village of Deir el-Medina and the Valley of the Kings
                                may have been a factor. Another consideration could have been the existence of a sacred
                                grotto dedicated to Hathor at the entrance of the Valley. This grotto may have been
                                associated with rejuvenation of the dead.

                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>he Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu was an important New
                                Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size
                                and architectural and artistic importance, the mortuary temple is probably best known as
                                the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the Sea Peoples
                                during the reign of Ramesses III.The first European to describe the temple in modern
                                literature was Vivant Denon, who visited it in 1799–1801. Jean-François Champollion
                                described it in detail in 1829.

                                Initial excavation of the temple took place sporadically between 1859 and 1899, under
                                the auspices of the Department of Antiquities. During these decades the main temple was
                                cleared, and a large number of the Greco-Roman period buildings, including a substantial
                                Byzantine Church in the second court, were destroyed without notes or records being
                                taken.

                                The further excavation, recording and conservation of the temple has been facilitated in
                                chief part by the Architectural and Epigraphic Surveys of the University of Chicago
                                Oriental Institute, almost continuously since 1924.

                                Egypt. It stands on the corniche, overlooking the west bank of the River Nile. The Luxor
                                Museum was inaugurated in 1975. It is a two-story building. The range of artifacts on
                                display is far more restricted than the country's main collections in the Egyptian
                                Museum in Cairo; this was, however, deliberate, since the museum prides itself on the
                                quality of the pieces it has, the uncluttered way in which they are displayed, and the
                                clear multilingual labeling used.[citation needed]

                                The museum was conceived by the Egyptian Ministry of Culture, which hired Dr. Mahmud El
                                Hakim, a top Egyptian architect, to create the plans in 1962.[2] The installation of the
                                museum art works came later and was finished between 1972 and 1975.
