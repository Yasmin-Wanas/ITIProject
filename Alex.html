                            <p> <br><b> History:</b>The Citadel of Qaitbay (or the Fort of Qaitbay; Arabic: قلعة
                                قايتباي‎) is a 15th-century
                                defensive fortress located on the Mediterranean sea coast, in Alexandria, Egypt. It was
                                established in 1477 AD (882 AH) by Sultan Al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Qa'it Bay. The Citadel
                                is situated on the eastern side of the northern tip of Pharos Island at the mouth of the
                                Eastern Harbour. The Qaitbay Citadel in Alexandria is considered one of the most
                                important defensive strongholds, not only in Egypt, but also along the Mediterranean Sea
                                coast. It formulated an important part of the fortification system of Alexandria in the
                                15th century AD. The Citadel is situated at the entrance of the eastern harbour on the
                                eastern point of the Pharos Island. It was erected on the exact site of the famous
                                Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The
                                lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several
                                disasters occurred and the shape of the lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it
                                still continued to function. Restoration began in the period of Ahmed Ibn Tulun (about
                                880 AD). During the 11th century an earthquake occurred, causing damage to the octagonal
                                part. The bottom survived, but it could only serve as a watchtower, and a small mosque
                                was built on the top. In the 14th century there was a very destructive earthquake and
                                the whole building was completely destroyed</p>

                                Montaza Palace (Arabic: قصر المنتزه‎) is a palace, museum and extensive gardens in the
                                Montaza district of Alexandria, Egypt. It was built on a low plateau east of central
                                Alexandria overlooking a beach on the Mediterranean Sea. The extensive Montaza Palace
                                grounds first had the Salamlek Palace, built in 1892 by Khedive Abbas II, the last
                                Muhammad Ali Dynasty ruler to hold the Khedive title over the Khedivate of Egypt and
                                Sudan. It was used as a hunting lodge and residence for his companion.

                                The larger Al-Haramlik Palace and royal gardens were added to the Montaza Palace
                                grounds, being built by King Fuad I in 1932, as a summer palace. It is in a mixture of
                                Ottoman and Florentine styles, with two towers. One of these towers rises distinctively
                                high above with elaborated Italian Renaissance design details. The palace has long open
                                arcades facing the sea along each floor.

                                President Anwar El-Sadat renovated the original Salamlek Palace as an official
                                presidential residence. It was most recently used by former president Hosni Mubarak.

                                Pompey's Pillar (Arabic: عمود السواري‎) is the name given to a Roman triumphal column in
                                Alexandria, Egypt. Set up in honour of the augustus Diocletian between 298-302 AD, the
                                giant Corinthian column originally supported a colossal porphyry statue of the emperor
                                in armour. It stands at the eastern side of the temenos of the Serapeum of
                                Alexandria, beside the ruins of the temple of Serapis itself. The erroneous name and
                                association with Pompey stems from historical misreading of the Greek dedicatory
                                inscription on the base. In 297 Diocletian, augustus since 284, campaigned in Egypt to
                                suppress the revolt of the usurper Domitius Domitianus. After a long siege, Diocletian
                                captured Alexandria and executed Domitianus's successor Aurelius Achilleus in 298. In
                                302 the emperor returned to the city and inaugurated a state grain supply.[2] The
                                dedication of the column monument and its statue of Diocletian, describes Diocletian as
                                polioúchos (Ancient Greek: πολιοῦχον Ἀλεξανδρείας, romanized: polioúchon Alexandreias,
                                lit. 'city-guardian-god ACC of Alexandria').In the fourth century AD this
                                designation also applied to Serapis, the male counterpart of Isis in the pantheon
                                instituted by the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt, the Ptolemies. The sanctuary
                                complex dedicated to Serapis in which the column was originally erected, the Serapeum,
                                was built under King Ptolemy III Euergetes in the third century BC and probably rebuilt
                                in the era of the second century AD emperor Hadrian after sustaining damage in the Kitos
                                Wars; in the later fourth century AD it was considered by Ammianus Marcellinus a marvel
                                rivalled only by Rome's sanctuary to Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, the
                                Capitolium.

                            <p><b>History :</b>The catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa (Arabic: مقابر كوم الشقافة‎; meaning
                                "Mound of Shards") is a historical archaeological site located in Alexandria, Egypt, and
                                is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.

                                The necropolis consists of a series of Alexandrian tombs, statues and archaeological
                                objects of the Pharaonic funeral cult with Hellenistic and early Imperial Roman
                                influences. Due to the time period, many of the features of the catacombs of Kom El
                                Shoqafa merge Roman, Greek and Egyptian cultural points; some statues are Egyptian in
                                style, yet bear Roman clothes and hair style whilst other features share a similar
                                style. A circular staircase, which was often used to transport deceased bodies down the
                                middle of it, leads down into the tombs that were tunneled into the bedrock during the
                                age of the Antonine emperors (2nd century AD). The facility was then used as a burial
                                chamber from the 2nd century to the 4th century, before being rediscovered in 1900 when
                                a donkey accidentally fell into the access shaft. To date, three sarcophagi have been
                                found, along with other human and animal remains which were added later. It is believed
                                that the catacombs were only intended for a single family, but it is unclear why the
                                site was expanded in order to house numerous other individuals.

                                Another feature of the catacombs is the Hall of Caracalla, which contains the bones of
                                horses which were the tombs created for the horses of the emperor Caracalla in 215
                                AD.

                            <p> br> <b>History: </b>The Port of Alexandria is on the West Verge of the Nile Delta
                                between the Mediterranean Sea and Mariut Lake in Alexandria, Egypt, and is considered
                                the second most important city and the main port in Egypt. Alexandria port consists of
                                two harbours (East and West) separated by a T-shaped peninsula. The East harbour is
                                shallow and is not navigable by large vessels. The West harbour is used for commercial
                                shipping. The harbour is formed by two converging breakwaters. Alexandria Port is one of
                                the oldest ports in the world. The earliest port facilities were built in 1900 BC in the
                                then-village of Rhakotis, to service coastal shipping and supply the island of Pharos
                                (now part of the "Ras al-Tin" quarter).


                                Plan of Alexandria c. 30 BC
                                Over the centuries sand and silt deposits made the port unnavigable. It was cleared by
                                forces under the command of Alexander the Great in 331 BC as part of the construction of
                                Alexandria city to be the marine base for his fleet. Alexander's engineer Dinocrat
                                linked the port of Alexandria and the island of Pharos with a bridge 1200 meters long
                                and 200 meters wide, creating two harbour basins for commercial and military shipping.
                                The northeast basin (Portus Magnus, currently the Eastern harbour) was designed for
                                military vessels and the southwest basin (Portus Eunostus, currently the main port of
                                Alexandria) was for commercial use. In the Ptolemy era a second bridge was built to
                                Pharos, further dividing the eastern harbour into two separate inlets.

                                According to Strabo, Alexandria had an inland harbour on Lake Mareotis as well as the
                                harbours on the Mediterranean. The lake had no mouth connecting it to the sea but was
                                instead connected to the Nile by canals. Strabo describes the lake harbour as being
                                busier than the harbours on the sea. During the period of Roman Egypt, grain was
                                exported in large quantities from the city's Western Harbour, earning it the name
                                "Portus Magnus". The grain was brought down the Nile by barge and stored in large
                                granaries near the shore of Lake Mareotis before shipping. At the height of the Roman
                                Empire, Alexandria was shipping 83,000 tons of grain per year to Rome. By the time of
                                the late Empire, the city was shipping 220,000 tons of grain per year to
                                Constantinople.

                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>The Graeco-Roman Museum is an archaeological museum located in
                                Alexandria, Egypt. Erected in 1892, it was first built in a five-room apartment, inside
                                one small building on Rosetta Street (later Avenue Canope and now Horriya). In 1895, it
                                was transferred to another, larger building near Gamal Abdul Nasser Street. The museum
                                contains several pieces dating from the Greco-Roman (Ptolemaic) era in the 3rd century
                                BC, such as a sculpture of Apis in black granite, the sacred bull of the Egyptians,
                                mummies, sarcophagus, tapestries, and other objects offering a view of Greco-Roman
                                civilization in contact with ancient Egypt.

                                The museum's collection is the product of donations from wealthy Alexandrians as well as
                                of excavations led by successive directors of the institution, both within the town and
                                in its environs. Certain other objects have come from the Organization of Antiquities at
                                Cairo (particularly those of the Pharaonic period) and from various digs undertaken at
                                the beginning of the century in Fayoum and at Benhasa. Housed within a historic building
                                whose beautiful neoclassical facade of six columns and pediment bears the large Greek
                                inscription ‘MOYΣEION’ (MOUSEION). The museum consists of 27 halls and an attractive
                                garden, which offer an excellent introduction to Egypt's Greco-Roman period.

                                The museum has been closed for renovations since 2005.[1] As of June 2017, the building
                                was still surrounded by scaffolding.

                            <p> <br><b>History: </b>The cathedral is said to stand on the site of the church founded by
                                St. Mark the Evangelist in AD 42.[citation needed]

                                St. Mark the Evangelist (author of the second Gospel) has been connected with the city
                                of Alexandria since earliest Christian tradition. Coptic Christians believe he arrived
                                in Alexandria around AD 42 and stayed for about seven years.[citation needed]

                                During this time, Mark converted many to Christianity and performed many miracles. He is
                                considered the founder of the church in Alexandria and the first Bishop of Alexandria.
                                According to tradition, St. Mark was arrested during a festival of Serapis in AD 68 and
                                martyred by being dragged through the streets. He was buried under the church he had
                                founded. n AD 311, before the martyrdom of Pope Peter the Last of Martyrs, he prayed a
                                last prayer on the grave of Saint Mark, the church was then a little chapel on the
                                eastern coast[citation needed], and it contained bodies said to be of Saint Mark and
                                some of his holy successors. The church was later enlarged in the days of Pope Achillas,
                                the 18th Pope.

                                The church was greatly ruined in 641 when the Arabs invaded Egypt. In 680 Pope John III
                                rebuilt the church. In 828, the body of Saint Mark was stolen by Italian sailors and was
                                taken from Alexandria to Venice in Italy. However, Saint Mark's head remained in
                                Alexandria.

                                The church was destroyed again in 1219, during the time of the crusades, then it was
                                rebuilt once more. Sixteenth-century French explorer Pierre Belon mentions the founding
                                of the church in 1547.[5]

                                The church was pulled down during the French invasion of Alexandria in July 1798. The
                                church was rebuilt and opened in 1819 by Pope Peter El Gawly in the time of Mohammed Ali
                                Pasha. The church was renewed in the time of Pope Demetrius II and by the supervision of
                                Bishop Marcos of El Behira in 1870. Between the years 1950–1952, in the time of Pope
                                Yusab II, the church building was pulled down and another, larger building was built
                                with reinforced concrete after the basilique style. The six marble pillars were
                                transferred into the outer entrance of the church. The icon carrier was accurately cut
                                into parts, each part given a number, and then it was cautiously returned to where it
                                was originally. The two bell tower were not pulled down as they were reinforced with
                                concrete and were decorated with beautiful Coptic engravings. Two new bells – brought
                                from Italy – were provided, one for each bell tower.

                                Between 1985 and 1990, the church was widened from the western side after the former
                                style with great accuracy, keeping the two bell tower in their places, so the entire
                                area of the church was doubled. The six pillars were transferred to the new western
                                entrance of the church supervised by Pope Shenouda III
