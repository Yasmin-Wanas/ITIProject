                                When the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt, Ras Muhammad was declared for protection
                                from fishing and other human activities. Some of the fishing methods, such as using
                                dynamite and knives also were impacting the coral reef and the fish populations. In
                                1983, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) established the area as a marine
                                reserve for the protection of marine and terrestrial wildlife. The park was also
                                established to protect against urban sprawl from Sharm El Sheikh and other coastal
                                development.[2] The name literally means "Mohammad's Head", where "head" in this
                                instance means "headland". There is a saying in the area that the name arose because in
                                side view the contour of the cliff looks like the profile of a bearded man's face, with
                                horizontal hard strata providing the nose and bearded chin.
